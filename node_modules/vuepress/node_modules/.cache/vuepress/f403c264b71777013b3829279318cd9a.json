While an individual composition can be a lot of fun on its own, the real power of ISF comes from being able to include them as smaller re-usable elements in larger projects.</p>\n<p>In this chapter we will look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tools for creating and editing ISF compositions.</li>\n<li>How the compositions that we create for this book, or ones that you download from the web, can be used in different host software and environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"tools-for-creating-editing-and-publishing-isf-compositions\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#tools-for-creating-editing-and-publishing-isf-compositions\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Tools for creating, editing and publishing ISF compositions</h2>\n<p>For the most part while reading this book you can use the provided code editing section, you may find it useful to work with one of the other available methods, as these will be the tools you will later use to write ISF compositions to load into other software or publish online.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-a-text-editor\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#using-a-text-editor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Using a text editor</h3>\n<p>You can write and edit shader files using most standard text editors.  When using a text editor</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When saving documents make sure to use the &quot;.fs&quot; extension for fragment shaders.  Unless otherwise specified all of the examples in this book use only a single fragment shader file.</li>\n<li>In a later chapter we will discuss optionally including a vertex shader, which use the &quot;.vs&quot; file extension, as part of an ISF composition.</li>\n<li>If you use TextEdit on the Mac, make sure to use the &quot;Make Plain Text&quot; option from the Format menu.</li>\n<li>You may also want to try out one of many great third party text editors such BBEdit, TextWrangler, TextMate, Sublime Text, Xcode and Atom which include syntax highlighting for GLSL.</li>\n<li>Like most programming languages, if you enjoy command line text editors such as Vim, Emacs or Nano, these also work just fine for writing GLSL code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-online-isf-editor\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-online-isf-editor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> The Online ISF Editor</h3>\n<p>ISF files can be created, viewed and shared online at the <a href=\"http://interactiveshaderformat.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">isf.video<OutboundLink/></a> website.

In this section we will briefly look at how ISF works in a few different pieces of software, but for detailed information you may want to consult with the corresponding documentation provided by the developer.</p>\n<p>On the Mac, compositions that are located in the &quot;/Library/Graphics/ISF/&quot; and &quot;~/Library/Graphics/ISF/&quot; directories are considered to be global and are commonly automatically accessed by any software that supports the specification.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vdmx\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#vdmx\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> VDMX</h3>\n<p>The ISF specification was originally designed for use in <a href=\"http://vidvox.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VDMX<OutboundLink/></a> and is a fitting first example.</p>\n<p>ISF compositions installed in the global directories are automatically detected and included as available assets in the appropriate place:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ISF Generators can be found in the Layer Source menu, or added to media bin pages where they can be triggered to layers like any other source.  When using ISF Generators, the rendering resolution can be specified from the Layer Source inspector.</li>\n<li>ISF FX can be found in the Load Asset menu in the Layer FX.  Each composition is placed in its specified categories.  The list of FX can also be browsed from the Assets section of the Workspace Inspector.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, ISF Generators that are located in other directories on your computer can be directly loaded into media bin pages by dragging from the Finder or using the Media Browser window.</p>\n<p>Whether being used as a generator or FX any elements specified in the <code>INPUTS</code> for the ISF composition will be available as user interface controls.  For example, inputs of type &quot;float&quot; appear as sliders, &quot;bools&quot; will appear as toggle buttons, and &quot;colors&quot; will appear as color pickers.  The exception to this is when using &quot;inputImage&quot; to declare an FX, as this element is used to pass the incoming layer image into the shader.</p>\n<p>For an example of using audio waveforms and FFTs see <a href=\"https://vdmx.vidvox.net/tutorials/visualizing-audio-analysis-fft-and-waveforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the VDMX tutorial on visualizing audio fft and waveforms<OutboundLink/></a>.</p>\n<p>Additional tutorials on using ISF in VDMX can be found on the <a href=\"https://vdmx.vidvox.net/search?q=ISF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VDMX Tutorials Site<OutboundLink/></a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-supported-software\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#other-supported-software\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Other supported software</h3>\n<p>Here are links to websites of a few different other softwares that support the ISF specification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://imimot.com/cogevj/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoGe<OutboundLink/></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bigfug.com/software/fugio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fugio<OutboundLink/></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://madmapper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mad Mappper<OutboundLink/></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.millumin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Millumin<OutboundLink/></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"using-isf-in-webgl\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#using-isf-in-webgl\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Using ISF in WebGL</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/msfeldstein/interactive-shader-format-js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interactive-shader-format-js<OutboundLink/></a> project includes code for loading and rendering ISF compositions as part of a WebGL pipeline.
