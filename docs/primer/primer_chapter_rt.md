# Introduction to Ray Tracing

Ray Tracing is a commonly used technique for rendering 3D shapes and objects into a 2D image.

In this chapter we'll look at:
- What is Ray Tracing?
- A simple example demonstrating functions for a few basic shapes, eg cube, sphere, plane
- A more in depth look at the math behind Ray Tracing
- A generalized approach and more advanced use cases
